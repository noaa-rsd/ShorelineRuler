**Shoreline Ruler**

This tool calculates the total length of polyline features contained in the specified shoreline shapfile(s).  The calculations are done based on the corresponding UTM (NAD83 2011) zone, as determined based on the longitude midpoint of shapefile's extent.  A summary ASCII table is displayed in the command output window.  The user also has the option to generate a detailed ArcGIS table of the results per C-COAST class.

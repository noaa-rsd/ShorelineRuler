**Shoreline Ruler**

This tool calculates the total length of features contained in the specified shoreline shapfile(s). The spatial reference of input files is assumed to be unprojected degrees (NAD83), but the calculations are done based on the corresponding UTM (NAD83 2011) zone. A text summary table is displayed in the command output window. The user also has the option to create a detailed table of the results per C-COAST class.
